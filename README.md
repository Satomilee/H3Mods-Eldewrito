# H3Mods-Eldewrito-0.6/0.6.1

A Collection of my Halo 3 mods for Eldewrito 0.6 and 0.6.1

# To Install with FMM:

1. Place h3mods/ reachMods folders in Halo Online\Mods\Tagmods
2. Open FMM and Install mods at highest priority - Halo 3 hud must be installed before weapons.

# Additional Information

DO NOT install mods which will affect the same game assets, this will corrupt your tags thus breaking your Eldewrito install.

Currently Issues with Installing h3 mods together, result of the tagmods having conflicting created tags (WIP).
